## Repository Structure
- `practical2/` to `practical9/`: Each directory corresponds to a week's practical session and includes relevant source code and files.

## Compilation and Execution
To compile and run the programs, navigate to the respective practical directory and use a C compiler like GCC:
```sh
gcc filename.c -o output_executable
./output_executable
```
Replace `filename.c` with the specific C source file and `output_executable` with your desired name.

## Dependencies
- C compiler (e.g., GCC).
